# Source Code Update 11/27/17 by Brennan Lefler
We have 3 classes implemented. The main thread, the sample data structure, and the project workflow. The workflow is where most of the implementation will go. I have added comments and function prototypes for the group to guide us along, but feel free to add or remove functions as needed. 

I also went ahead and implemented a function to normalize the data, which successfully converts all of the data to values between 0..1. IMPORTANT: The normalized data we will be using is in an ArrayList named "samplesNorm". Any processing of the data must be done on this list, and not any of the others. The "features" ArrayList holds the attribute names, so if you need to get those header names, call that list. 

Unless absolutely necessary, please do not make any changes to any of the functions that import the data or read the data. Everything works as needed to bring in all of the samples and there corresponding features. I know there will be questions about the code as we move forward, so feel free to ask me about it.

As of right now, the GUI is working with a file chooser to select the data. It will only read .CSV and .txt files, which are the normal file types in this area of study. Feel free to mess around with it and identify any issues you find so we can fix them.
