Machine Learning Project 3: Relief and Bayes Classifier Program by 
Brennan Lefler, Barry Glass, Alex Hughes, Nicholas Fragoman, & Justin Mitchell

The program loads files of any sample length and feature length and will use Relief algorithm
to determine the weakest feature. Then, it will classify each sample using the Bayes Classifier algorithm.
